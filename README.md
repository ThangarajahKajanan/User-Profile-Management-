# User-Profile-Management- (PHP)
•	In my 1st-year 2nd-semester project, I utilized Draw.io to design wireframes for a PHP-based User Management System. 
•	I contributed to the development of a User Management System, focusing on user registration, updating user details, and implementing a search function. Additionally, users have the ability to securely delete their accounts.
